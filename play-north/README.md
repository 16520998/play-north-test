### Overview
This project is like a hub for games, made using ReactJS 18 and NextJS 14. You can easily move around different game categories, check out game lists, and search for specific games. I've used TypeScript, Redux to handle stuff behind the scenes, SASS for styling, and server-side rendering (SSR) to make everything run smoother.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
